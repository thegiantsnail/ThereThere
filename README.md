ThereThere: Enhanced Touch Theremin
üéµ ThereThere is a responsive, multi-touch web-based theremin application designed for modern browsers, with a particular focus on compatibility and performance for PlayStation homebrew environments via HTML/Lua interfaces. It offers a rich musical experience with multiple waveforms, stackable effects, real-time recording, and melody playback.

üöÄ Project Overview
